## Timestamp Display in Product Edit Page

### Overview
The product edit page now displays two timestamps:
- **Created At**: Shows the initial creation date of the product
- **Last Updated**: Shows the most recent update timestamp

### Implementation Details
- Location: `admin_templates/product_edit.html`
- Timestamps are displayed using Django's date template filter
- Format: `Y-m-d H:i` (e.g., `2023-06-15 14:30`)

### Usage
Timestamps are automatically populated and updated by the Django model's `created_at` and `updated_at` fields.

### Example
```html
<small class="text-muted">Last Updated: {{ product.updated_at|date:"Y-m-d H:i" }}</small>
<p class="text-muted">Created: {{ product.created_at|date:"Y-m-d H:i" }}</p>
```

### Benefits
- Provides clear visibility into product creation and modification history
- Helps track product lifecycle
- Improves user understanding of product metadata
