## Product Edit Page Timestamps

The product edit page now displays two key timestamps for each product:

1. **Created At**: Shows the original creation date of the product
   - Located at the top of the product edit form
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
   - Example: `2024-01-15 14:30`

2. **Last Updated**: Displays the most recent modification timestamp
   - Located in the card header
   - Format: `Month DD, YYYY HH:MM AM/PM`
   - Example: `January 15, 2024 02:30 PM`

### Purpose
These timestamps provide clear visibility into:
- When the product was first created
- The most recent modification date

### Implementation Details
- Timestamps are derived from Django model fields `created_at` and `updated_at`
- Formatting uses Django's built-in date template filter
