## Product Deletion Confirmation

### Overview
A confirmation dialog has been added to prevent accidental product deletions in the admin interface.

### Behavior
- When attempting to delete a product, a browser confirmation dialog appears
- Dialog message: "Are you sure you want to delete this product?"
- Clicking "OK" proceeds with deletion
- Clicking "Cancel" prevents deletion

### Implementation Details
- Located in: `DjangoEcommerceApp/templates/admin_templates/product_list.html`
- Implemented using JavaScript's `confirm()` function
- Added to the delete button's `onclick` event

### Example
```html
<a href="#" onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this product?');" class="btn btn-warning btn-sm">Delete</a>
```

### Best Practices
- Prevents unintended data loss
- Provides a simple, user-friendly confirmation mechanism
