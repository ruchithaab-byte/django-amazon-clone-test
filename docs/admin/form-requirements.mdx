# Form Field Requirements

## Required Field Indication

In the admin templates, required form fields are automatically marked with a red asterisk (*) to indicate mandatory fields.

### Implementation Details

- The asterisk is dynamically added using Django template logic
- Only fields marked as `required=True` in the form definition will show the asterisk
- The asterisk is styled with a red color to stand out

### Example

```html
<label>{{ field.label }}{% if field.field.required %} <span style="color: red;">*</span>{% endif %}</label>
```

This approach ensures that users are immediately aware of which fields must be filled out when creating or editing records.
