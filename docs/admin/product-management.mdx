# Product Management

The product management section allows administrators to manage products in the e-commerce platform.

## Product List View

The product list view displays all products in a card-based layout with the following features:

### Search and Filter
- **Search**: Use the search box to filter products by name
- **Sort Options**: Sort products by ID, Title, Description, or Created At date

### Empty State Handling

When no products exist in the system, users are presented with a helpful empty state message:

> **No products found.** [Create your first product!](#)

This user-friendly message:
- Clearly indicates that the product list is empty
- Provides a direct link to the product creation page
- Improves the user experience for new stores or filtered searches with no results

### Product Cards

Each product card displays:
- Product image
- Product name
- Subcategory badge
- URL slug
- Creation date and time
- Active status toggle
- Action buttons:
  - **Edit**: Modify product details
  - **Add Media**: Upload product images
  - **Edit Media**: Manage existing media
  - **Add Stocks**: Manage inventory

### Pagination

The product list supports pagination for better performance with large catalogs.

## Creating Products

Navigate to the product creation page using:
- The "Create your first product!" link (when list is empty)
- The product creation menu item
- The "Back to Product List" button to return after creation

## Best Practices

1. **Add descriptive product names**: Clear names help with search and SEO
2. **Include product images**: Visual content improves conversion rates
3. **Manage stock levels**: Keep inventory updated to avoid overselling
4. **Use meaningful URL slugs**: Custom slugs improve SEO
