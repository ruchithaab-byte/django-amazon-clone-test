## Product CSV Export Feature

### Overview
The product list page now supports exporting the entire product list to a CSV file, preserving current filters and sorting.

### How to Use
1. Navigate to the Product List page
2. Click the "Export to CSV" button located in the search bar
3. The CSV will download with the following columns:
   - Product ID
   - Product Name
   - Brand
   - Category
   - Subcategory
   - Maximum Price
   - Discounted Price
   - Total Stock
   - Creation Date

### Export Behavior
- Maintains current search filters
- Respects sorting preferences
- Filename: `products_export.csv`

### Technical Implementation
- Located in `AdminViews.py`
- Uses Django's built-in CSV module
- Leverages existing list view filtering logic
- Preserves user context during export

### Considerations
- Requires admin/staff authentication
- No pagination in exported CSV
- Exports only currently filtered results
