title: Product Form Character Count Indicator
description: Implementation of character count display for product description fields
---

## Overview

We've added a character count indicator to product description textareas in both product create and edit forms. This feature helps users track their input against the 500-character limit.

### Features
- Real-time character count display
- Maximum limit of 500 characters set on textareas
- Character count updates dynamically as user types
- Displayed below each textarea with format: "Current Count/Maximum Limit"

### Implementation Details
- Added to both `product_create.html` and `product_edit.html`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript for count tracking
- Minimal performance impact
- Graceful degradation if JavaScript is disabled

### Example
```html
<textarea class="form-control char-count-input" maxlength="500"></textarea>
<small class="text-muted">Character count: <span>0</span>/500</small>
```

### Compatibility
- Works with existing form handling
- No changes required to backend logic
- Supports all modern browsers
