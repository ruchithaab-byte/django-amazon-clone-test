## Product Edit Timestamp Feature

### Overview
A new feature has been added to the product edit page to display the timestamp of when the product was created.

### Implementation Details
- Location: `DjangoEcommerceApp/templates/admin_templates/product_edit.html`
- Added a new `<p>` element to display the `created_at` timestamp
- Timestamp format: `Y-m-d H:i`
- Styling: Uses Bootstrap's `text-muted` class for subtle appearance

### Example
```html
<p class="text-muted">Created: {{ product.created_at|date:"Y-m-d H:i" }}</p>
```

### Purpose
Provides administrators with clear visibility into when a product was initially created in the system.
