# Product Edit Page Timestamp Feature

## Overview
The product edit page now displays two timestamps to provide context about the product's lifecycle:

- **Created At**: Shows when the product was initially created
- **Last Updated**: Displays the most recent modification timestamp

### Usage
The timestamps are automatically managed by Django's model fields:
- `created_at`: Automatically set when the product is first created
- `updated_at`: Updated each time the product is modified

### Example
```html
<p class="text-muted">Created: {{ product.created_at|date:"Y-m-d H:i" }}</p>
<small class="text-muted">Last Updated: {{ product.updated_at|date:"F d, Y h:i A" }}</small>
```

## Benefits
- Provides clear visibility into product history
- Helps track when products were last modified
- Improves administrative transparency
