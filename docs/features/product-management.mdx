# Product Edit Page Timestamps

## Timestamp Display

The product edit page includes two key timestamps for each product:

- **Created At**: Shows the original creation date of the product
- **Last Updated**: Displays the most recent modification timestamp

### Implementation Details

Timestamps are displayed using Django's template date filter:

```django
<small class="text-muted">Last Updated: {{ product.updated_at|date:"Y-m-d H:i" }}</small>
<p class="text-muted">Created: {{ product.created_at|date:"Y-m-d H:i" }}</p>
```

### Purpose

These timestamps provide users with clear information about:
- When the product was initially created
- The most recent modifications made to the product

### Location

Timestamps are displayed in the `product_edit.html` template within the admin section.
