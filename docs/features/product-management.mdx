## Product Edit Page Timestamps

The product edit page now displays two important timestamps:

- **Created At**: Shows the timestamp of when the product was initially created
- **Last Updated**: Displays the most recent modification timestamp

These timestamps help track the product's history and provide context for when changes were made.

### Location
- Found in the product edit page header
- Displayed in a muted text format for clear but non-intrusive visibility

### Example
```html
<p class="text-muted">Created: {{ product.created_at|date:"Y-m-d H:i" }}</p>
<small class="text-muted">Last Updated: {{ product.updated_at|date:"F d, Y h:i A" }}</small>
```
