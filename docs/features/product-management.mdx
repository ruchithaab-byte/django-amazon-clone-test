# Product Management Features

## Delete Product Confirmation

We've added a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental product deletions. When a user clicks the "Delete" button, a JavaScript confirmation dialog will appear with the message "Are you sure you want to delete this product?".

### Features
- Confirmation dialog prevents unintended product deletions
- User must explicitly confirm deletion action
- Provides an additional layer of data protection

### Implementation Details
- Added to `product_list.html` template
- Uses standard JavaScript `confirm()` function
- If user clicks "Cancel", deletion is cancelled
- If user clicks "OK", deletion proceeds
