## Product Deletion Confirmation

When deleting a product from the admin interface, a confirmation dialog appears to prevent accidental deletions. This helps protect against unintended data loss by requiring explicit user confirmation before removing a product.

### Confirmation Dialog

- When clicking the "Delete" button, a browser dialog appears
- Dialog text: "Are you sure you want to delete this product?"
- User can cancel the deletion by clicking "Cancel"
- Deletion proceeds only if user clicks "OK"
