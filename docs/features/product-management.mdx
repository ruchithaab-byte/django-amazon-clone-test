## Product List View Details

In the product list admin interface, each product row includes a "View" button that allows quick navigation to the product edit page.

### Features
- Located in the "Actions" column of the product list table
- Provides a direct link to edit the specific product
- Uses Django's URL routing to navigate to the product edit page

### Usage
Each product row has a "View" button that, when clicked, takes you to the edit page for that specific product.

Example:
```html
<a href="{% url 'product_edit' product_id=product.product.id %}" class="btn btn-info btn-sm">View</a>
```

### Routing
The link uses the `product_edit` URL name, passing the product's unique ID to load the correct product details.
