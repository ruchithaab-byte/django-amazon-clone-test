## Product List View

### Product ID Column

In version AGENTIC-131, we added a dedicated Product ID column to the product list table. 

#### Changes
- Updated `/DjangoEcommerceApp/templates/admin_templates/product_list.html`
- Added a comment to clarify the purpose of the Product ID column

#### Purpose
The Product ID column provides quick reference to the unique identifier of each product, making it easier for administrators to track and manage products.
