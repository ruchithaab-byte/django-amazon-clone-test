## Product Edit Timestamps

The product edit page now displays two key timestamps:

- **Created At**: Shows when the product was initially created
- **Last Updated**: Displays the most recent modification time

### Implementation Details

- Located in: `DjangoEcommerceApp/templates/admin_templates/product_edit.html`
- Timestamps use Django's built-in date filter
- Format: 
  - Created: `Y-m-d H:i` (e.g., 2023-06-15 14:30)
  - Last Updated: `F d, Y h:i A` (e.g., June 15, 2023 02:30 PM)

### Usage Example

```html
<!-- Created timestamp -->
<p class="text-muted">Created: {{ product.created_at|date:"Y-m-d H:i" }}</p>

<!-- Last Updated timestamp -->
<small class="text-muted">Last Updated: {{ product.updated_at|date:"F d, Y h:i A" }}</small>
```

### Visibility
- Timestamps are displayed at the top of the product edit form
- Text is muted to provide contextual information without distracting from the main edit interface
