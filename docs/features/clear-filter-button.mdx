title: Clear Filter Button in Category and Subcategory Lists
description: Implementation of a "Clear Filter" button in admin list pages
---

## Overview
A "Clear" button has been added to the category and subcategory list pages in the admin interface. This button allows users to quickly reset the search/filter and view all items.

## Usage
- Located next to the search input field in both category and subcategory list pages
- Clicking the button removes any applied filters
- Instantly resets the view to show all items

### Implementation Details
- Button uses `btn-secondary` class for styling
- Uses Django's URL routing to reset the page without filter parameters
- Works consistently across category and subcategory list views
