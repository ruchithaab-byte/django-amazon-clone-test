# Product List Sort Functionality

## Overview

The product list page now supports dynamic sorting with visual indication of the current active sort option. Users can sort the product list by ID, Name, or Creation Date.

## Features

- Preserve filter state while sorting
- Visual highlighting of active sort option
- Consistent sorting across pagination
- Defaults to sorting by ID

## Sort Options

1. **ID Sort**
   - Sorts products by their unique identifier
   - Useful for systematic or chronological listing by registration order

2. **Name Sort**
   - Alphabetically sorts products by their name
   - Helps in quickly locating products based on their title

3. **Created At Sort**
   - Sorts products by their creation timestamp
   - Allows viewing newest or oldest products first

## Implementation Details

### URL Structure
```
/product_list?filter=[optional_filter]&orderby=[sort_field]&page=[page_number]
```

### Active Sort Styling
- Font weight increased
- Underlined text
- Distinct color (#007bff - Bootstrap primary)

## Best Practices

- Sort links preserve existing filter
- Pagination maintains current sort order
- Default sort is by ID
- Consistent across all admin list views (categories, subcategories, etc.)

## Backend Handling

Django's ListView is used with dynamic `.order_by()` method to handle sorting securely and efficiently.
