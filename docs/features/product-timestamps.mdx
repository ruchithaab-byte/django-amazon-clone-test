## Timestamp Display on Product Edit Page

### Overview
The product edit page now includes two key timestamps:
- **Created At**: Shows when the product was initially created
- **Last Updated**: Shows the most recent modification date

### Location
Timestamps are displayed in the card header and body of the product edit form.

### Date Formatting
- **Created At**: Formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
- **Last Updated**: Formatted as `Month DD, YYYY HH:MM AM/PM`

### Example
```html
<p class="text-muted">Created: {{ product.created_at|date:"Y-m-d H:i" }}</p>
<small class="text-muted">Last Updated: {{ product.updated_at|date:"F d, Y h:i A" }}</small>
```

### Purpose
These timestamps provide quick visibility into the product's lifecycle, helping administrators track when products were created and last modified.
