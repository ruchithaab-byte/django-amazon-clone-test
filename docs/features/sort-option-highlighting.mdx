## Sort Option Highlighting

### Overview
In version [current_version], we enhanced the sort option user experience by adding visual highlighting for the currently active sort option across admin list views.

### Implementation Details

#### Changes
- Added active state highlighting for sort options
- Converted text links to Bootstrap button-style links
- Preserved existing filter and pagination parameters

#### Affected Templates
- `category_list.html`
- `sub_category_list.html`

#### Highlighting Mechanism
Sort options now use a conditional class to indicate the active state:
```html
<a href="?orderby=field_name" 
   class="btn btn-sm 
          {% if orderby == 'field_name' %}btn-primary{% else %}btn-outline-secondary{% endif %}">
   Field Label
</a>
```

### Usage Example
When sorting by "ID", the ID sort option will appear as a primary (filled) button, while other sort options remain as outlined secondary buttons.

### Benefits
- Improved user experience
- Clear indication of current sort option
- Consistent styling across admin list views
