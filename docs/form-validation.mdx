## Required Field Indicators

In our Django application, required form fields are automatically marked with a red asterisk (*) to indicate that they are mandatory.

### How It Works

The template uses Django's form field attributes to dynamically display a red asterisk for required fields:

```html
<label>
  {{ field.label }}
  {% if field.field.required %} 
    <span style="color: red;">*</span>
  {% endif %}
</label>
```

### Benefits

- Clear visual indication of mandatory fields
- Improves user experience by setting expectations
- Reduces form submission errors

### Affected Forms

The following forms have been updated with required field indicators:
- Category Create/Update Forms
- Sub-Category Create/Update Forms
- Product Create/Edit Forms

### Customization

The red asterisk is styled inline with `style="color: red;"`. This can be further customized by adding a CSS class or modifying the styling as needed.
