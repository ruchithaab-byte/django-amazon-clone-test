## Required Field Indicators

In our Django admin templates, required form fields are automatically marked with a red asterisk (*) to improve user experience and clarity.

### Implementation Details

The indicator is added using a Django template tag that checks the `required` attribute of each form field:

```html
<label>
    {{ field.label }}
    {% if field.field.required %}
        <span style="color: red;">*</span>
    {% endif %}
</label>
```

### Affected Templates

- Category Create/Update Forms
- Sub-Category Create/Update Forms
- Product Create/Edit Forms

### Best Practices

- Always mark required fields with a clear visual indicator
- Use a consistent color (red in this implementation) to draw attention
- Ensure the asterisk is placed immediately after the field label
