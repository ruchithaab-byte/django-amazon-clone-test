## Product Edit Page Timestamp Display

The product edit page provides two key timestamps for tracking product modifications:

### Created Timestamp
- Located at the top of the product edit form
- Displays the original creation date and time
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
- Example: `Created: 2023-10-15 14:30`

### Last Updated Timestamp
- Located in the card header of the product edit form
- Shows the most recent modification date and time
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
- Example: `Last Updated: 2023-10-20 09:45`

### Implementation Details
- Uses Django's built-in date template filter
- Utilizes `product.created_at` and `product.updated_at` model fields
- Displayed using Bootstrap text styling classes
