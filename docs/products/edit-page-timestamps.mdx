## Timestamp Display on Product Edit Page

### Overview
The product edit page now displays two important timestamps:
- **Created At**: Shows the original creation date and time of the product
- **Last Modified**: Indicates the most recent update to the product

### Implementation Details
- Timestamps are displayed in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
- Located at the top of the product edit form
- Both timestamps use Django's date template filter for consistent formatting

### Example
```html
<div class="row mb-3">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p class="text-muted">Created: 2023-12-15 14:30</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 text-right">
        <p class="text-muted">Last Modified: 2023-12-20 09:45</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Benefits
- Provides clear visibility into product lifecycle
- Helps track when products were created and last updated
