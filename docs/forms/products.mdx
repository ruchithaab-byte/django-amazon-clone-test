## Character Count Indicator

Product description fields now include a real-time character count display to help users stay within the 500-character limit.

### Features
- Displays current character count (e.g., "0/500 characters")
- Updates dynamically as user types
- Applies to both product create and edit forms

### Example
```html
<textarea class="form-control char-count-input" maxlength="500">...</textarea>
<small class="text-muted">Character count: <span>0</span>/500</small>
```

### Implementation Details
- Character count is shown below the textarea
- Maxlength attribute prevents exceeding 500 characters
- JavaScript event listener updates count in real-time

### Use Cases
- Helps users understand text input constraints
- Prevents submissions with overly long descriptions
